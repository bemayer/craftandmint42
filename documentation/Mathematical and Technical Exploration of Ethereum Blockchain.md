## Hash functions and Merkle Trees

### General properties of hash functions

A hash function is a type of function that has a particular use in the field of computer science and information security.

### Definition

A hash function $H$ is a process that takes an input value of any length $x$ and returns a fixed-size string of bytes $H(x)$ , typically a digest that appears random. The output, called the hash value, should be the same length regardless of the length of the input and should look random. A good hash function also makes it computationally infeasible to regenerate the original input value given the hash value, and to generate two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

### Mathematical Representation

A hash function can be represented as follows:

$$
H: \{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^n
$$

where ${0, 1}^*$ is the set of all possible inputs (of any length) and ${0, 1}^n$ is the set of all possible outputs (of fixed length $n$).

### Properties

Hash functions have certain properties that make them useful in cryptography and data integrity verification:

#### Deterministic

The same input should always produce the same output.

$$
\forall x, y \in \mathcal{M}, x = y \Rightarrow H(x) = H(y)
$$

#### Pre-image Resistance

It should be computationally infeasible to reverse engineer the original input value given the hash value.

$$
\forall h \in H(\mathcal{M}), \nexists x \in \mathcal{M} : H(x) = h
$$

#### Second Pre-image Resistance

It should be computationally difficult to find a second input that produces the same hash value as a given input.

$$
\forall x \in \mathcal{M}, \nexists y \in \mathcal{M}, x \neq y : H(x) = H(y)
$$

#### Collision Resistance

It should be computationnaly difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

$$
\nexists x, y \in \mathcal{M}, x \neq y : H(x) = H(y)
$$

#### Uniform Distribution

The hash values should be uniformly distributed over the output space, meaning every hash value in the ouput space is equally likely to occur.

$$
\forall h \in H(\mathcal{M}), P(H(x) = h) = \frac{1}{|H(\mathcal{M})|}
$$

#### Avalanche Effect

A small change in the input should result in a significant change in the output.

$$
\forall x, y \in \mathcal{M}, x \neq y \Rightarrow H(x) \neq H(y) \text{ and } d(H(x), H(y)) \approx \frac{|H(\mathcal{M})|}{2}
$$

where \(d\) is the Hamming distance.

The formula for the Avalanche Effect is not strictly mathematical but attempts to capture the essence that a small change in the input should produce such a drastic change in output that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value.

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) $d(H(x), H(y))$ measures how different two strings of equal length are.

### Example: Sum of ASCII values

Consider a simple hash function that adds the ASCII values of the characters in a string and returns the sum modulo 256. This hash function is not cryptographically secure, but it is useful for illustrating the properties of hash functions.

$$
H(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i \mod 256
$$

where $x_i$ is the ASCII value of the $i$th character in the string $x$.

Python implementation:
```python
def hash(x):
	return sum([ord(c) for c in x]) % 256
```

### Keccak-256

Keccak-256 is a cryptographic hash function that is used in the Ethereum blockchain. It is a member of the Keccak family of hash functions, which was selected as the winner of the NIST hash function competition in 2012. It has been chosen as SHA-3, the lastest member of the [Secure Hash Algorithm family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) of hash functions.

The implementation of this hash function is notably complex, yet an example of it is available in the core Solidity library on [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolutil/Keccak256.cpp).

## Merkle Trees

### Definition

A Merkle tree is a binary tree where each non-leaf node is the hash of its children, and each leaf node is the hash of some data block. It serves as a powerful tool to verify the integrity of data blocks in a dataset, particularly useful in distributed systems like blockchains.

### Mathematical Representation

A Merkle tree $T$ can be represented as a complete binary tree where eahc node $v$ contains a hash $H(v)$.

For any node $v$ at depth $d$:

- If $v$ is a leaf node, then $H(V) = H(D(V))$, where $D(v)$ is the data block associated with the leaf node.
- If $v$ is an internal node with children $l$ and $r$, then $H(v) = H(H(l) + H(r))$.

### Properties

#### Data Integrity

Changing a single data block necessitates the recalculation of hashes up to the root, making data tampering evident.

#### Efficient Verification

Given a data block and its pathway to the root, the integrity of the data block can be verified without examining the entire tree.

#### Collapsibility

Branches of the tree can be summarized into a single hash, reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted.

### Example: a Simple Merkle Tree

Consider a simple Merkle tree with 4 leafs $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$, $L_4$.

$$
\forall i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} : H_i = H(L_i)
$$

Internal nodes are:

- $H_5 = H(H_1 + H_2)$
- $H_6 = H(H_3 + H_4)$

The root is:

- $H_7 = H(H_5 + H_6)$

```mermaid

    end
    H5["H5 = H(H1 + H2)"]
    H6["H6 = H(H3 + H4)"]
    H1["H1 = H(L1)"]

```

## Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves are a fundamental part of the cryptographic algorithms used in Ethereum, specifically for generating and managing cryptographic keys and signatures.

### Definition of Elliptic Curves

Elliptic curves are a type of algebraic curve define over a field $F$ by an equation of the form:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants are elements of $F$ and $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$, ensuring that the curve has no singular points (i.e. no cusps or self-intersections).

This is referred to as the **Weierstrass equation**.


### Elliptic Curve on a Finite Field

When elliptic curves are used in cryptography they are often defined over finite fields, which are set of numbers with a finite count. There are two types of finite fields: prime fields ($\mathbb{F}_p$) and binary fields ($\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$). The field used in Ethereum is a prime field.


### Elliptic Curve over a Finite Prime Field ($\mathbb{F}_p$)

In a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p$ is a prime number, the elements are integers in the range $\{0, 1, \ldots, p-1\}$.

The equation of the elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is the same as the equation of the elliptic curve over the real numbers, but all operations are performed modulo $p$.

$$
y^2 = (x^3 + ax + b) \mod p
$$

### Example: *secp256k1* Curve

In the case of the Ethereum, the equation of the *secp256k1* curve is used. It is defined over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod p
$$

$$
p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1
$$

### Addition on an Elliptic Curve

Point addition on an elliptic curve is a fundamental operation that underpins elliptic curve cryptography. It is a way to combine two points on the curve to get a third point, also on the curve. This operation has a geometric interpretation involving lines intersecting the curve.

#### Adding Different Points ($P \neq Q$)

- Imagine two points $P$ and $Q$ on the elliptic curve. Draw a straight line through $P$ and $Q$.

- This line will intersect the elliptic curve at a third point $R'$.

- Reflect $R'$ across the $x$-axis to get $R$, which is the result of adding P and Q.

Mathematically, if $P=(x_1,y_1)$ and $Q=(x_2,y_2)$, the slope $m$ of the line through $P$ and $Q$ is given by:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

The coordinates of the point $R=(x_3,y_3)$, are given by:

$$
x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2
$$

$$
y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1
$$

![Elliptic Curve Addition](./Elliptic_Curve_Addition.png)

#### Adding a Point to Itself ($P = Q$)

- If you're adding a point to itself, $P+P$, or $2P$ (point doublingâ€º), draw the tangent line to the curve at $P$.

- This line will intersect the curve at a second point $R'$.

- Reflect $R'$ across the $x$-axis to get $R$, which is the result of adding $P$ to itself.

Mathematically, the slope $m$ of the tangent line at $P$ is given by:

$$
m = \frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1}
$$

(where $a$ is the constant in the Weierstrass equation).

The coordinates of the point $R=(x_3,y_3)$ are given by:

$$
x_3 = m^2 - 2x_1
$$

$$
y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1
$$

![Elliptic Curve Point Doubling](./Elliptic_Curve_Point_Doubling.png)

#### Adding the Point at Infinity ($P = \mathcal{O}$)

- In elliptic curve cryptography, the point at infinity $\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element for point addition.

- Adding the point at infinity to a point $P$ results in $P$.

- Formally: $\forall P \in E, P + \mathcal{O} = P$.

### Abelian Group Structure

An elliptic curve, when endowed with the operation of point addition, forms a structure known in mathematics as an abelian group. Here's a breakdown of its properties:

#### Closure

- When you add two points on the elliptic curve, the result is another point on the elliptic curve. This propery is known as closure.

- Formally: $\forall P, Q \in E, P + Q \in E$.

#### Associativity

- The way you group the points does not affect the sum.

- Formally, $(P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)$.

#### Identity

- There is a special point called the point at infinity, denoted as $\mathcal{O}$, that acts as the identity element for point addition.
When you add any point on the elliptic curve to the point at infinity, you get the original point back.

- Formally: $\forall P \in E, P + \mathcal{O} = P$.

#### Inverse

- Every point ont the elliptic curve has an inverse point that, when added together, result in the point at infinity.

- Formally: $\forall P \in E, \exists Q \in E : P + Q = \mathcal{O}$.

#### Commutativity (Abelian Property)

- The order in which you add the points doesn't matter.

- Formally: $P + Q = Q + P$.

### Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)

#### Point Multiplication by a Scalar

- Point multiplication is the operation of adding a point to itself a specified number of times.

- For example, $P + P + \ldots + P = n P$, where $P$ is added $n$ times.

- The addition is not efficient for large value of $n$. However, it can be made efficient using the double-and-add algorithm.

#### Double-and-add Algorithm

1. Convert the scalar $\lambda$ to its binary representation.

2. Starting from the leftmost bit, double the result and add the point $P$ if the bit is 1.

3. Continue until all bits have been processed.

Example:

Suppose we want to calculate $10P$. The binary representation of 10 is 0b1010. The double-and-add algorithm proceeds as follows:

- Start with $R = P$.

- Now go through each bit of the binary representation of 10, starting from the leftmost bit:
    - First bit (2nd from left) is 0: Double $R$ to get $2P$.
    - Second bit is 1: Double $R$ to get $4P$ and add $P$ to get $5P$.
    - Third bit is 0: Double $R$ to get $10P$.

The result is $10P$, as desired.

This algorithm is efficient because it only requires $O(\log_2 \lambda)$ point additions and doublings, making scalar multiplication computationally feasible even for large values of $\lambda$.

#### Discrete logarithm problem

> The essence of the discrete logarithm problem is that while it is straightforward to compute $Q$ given $\lambda$ and $P$ through the expression $Q=\lambda P$, reversing this process to determine the scalar $\lambda$ given $Q$ and $P$ is computationally very challenging. This asymmetry forms the foundation for the security underpinning elliptic curve cryptography.

To give an estimate the point addition whose code is given below took $57\mu s$ to execute on my computer. This means that it would take $57\mu s \times 2^{256} \approx 10^{70}$ years to compute the discrete logarithm problem for the *secp256k1* curve, i.e. with a scalar of 256 bits.

Using the Double-and-add method, we can compute $\lambda P$ in $O(\log_2 \lambda)$ point additions and doublings. It would take $57\mu s \times 256 \approx 15ms$ to compute.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in Ethereum

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) forms the bedrock of Ethereum's security and identity management. Through the use of elliptic curves, Ethereum is able to provide unique digital identities to users, secure transactions, and ensure the integrity and authenticity of data. The chosen elliptic curve for Ethereum is *secp256k1*, which is defined over a finite field and provides a good balance between security and performance.

### Base Point and its Order

In elliptic curve cryptography, a base point $G$ is a fixed point on the curve that is used to generate a public key from a private key. The base point is also known as the generator point.

The order of the base point, denoted as $n$, is a fundamental characteristic of the elliptic curve group. It is the smallest positive integer such that $nG = \mathcal{O}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity.

The base point $G$ generates all other elements of the group through repeated additions of $G$ to itself. Each iteration of adding $G$ to itself generates a new element in the group, and this process can be repeated until we circle back to the starting point, $G$. This iterative generation of group elements by the repetitive addition of the base point $G$ to itself creates a cyclic structure, forming a cyclic group.

A cyclic group is defined by the property that all elements in the group can be generated by iterating the group operation on a particular element, the generator (in this case, $G$), of the group. In the context of elliptic curve cryptography, the group operation is point addition.

Formally, a group $\mathcal{G}$ is termed cyclic if there exists an element $G$ in $\mathcal{G}$ such that:

$$
\forall g \in \mathcal{G}, \exists \lambda \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} : g = \lambda G
$$

The order of $G$, symbolized as $n$, is pivotal since it shapes the cyclic subgroup spawned by $G$. It is defined as the smallest positive integer satisfying $nG = \mathcal{O}$, with $\mathcal{O}$ representing the point at infinity, serving as the group's identity element. The cyclic subgroup $\langle G \rangle$ encompasses all points derivable from iterative additions of $G$, expressed as $\langle G \rangle = \{ G, 2G, 3G, \ldots, (n-1)G \}$. Both the cyclic subgroup and $G$ share the order $n$, indicating the presence of $n$ unique elements within the subgroup $\langle G \rangle$ created by $G$.

For the *secp256k1* curve, the base point $G$ is defined as:

$$
G = (55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240,\\
32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424)
$$

And its order $n$ is:

$$
n = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337
$$

Another value given for *secp256k1* curve is its cofactor $h$, which is defined as:

$$
h = \frac{\#E(\mathbb{F}_p)}{n}
$$

where $\#E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is the number of points on the curve over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$.

For *secp256k1*, $h = 1$, meaning that the number of points on the curve is equal to the order of the base point.

### Full Standards for *secp256k1*

According to the standards defining the *secp256k1* curve ([Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG)](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)):

> The elliptic curve domain parameters over $\mathbb{F}_p$ associated with a Koblitz curve secp256k1 are specified by the sextuple T = (p, a, b, G, n, h)

The six parameters have been defined, as a reminder:
- $p$ is the prime number defining the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$.

$$
p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1
$$

- $a$ and $b$ are the constants in the Weierstrass equation.

$$
a = 0
$$

$$
b = 7
$$

$$
y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod p
$$

- $G$ is the base point.

$$
G = (\texttt{79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815 B16F81798}
,\\ \texttt{483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8})
$$

- $n$ is the order of the base point.

$$
n = \texttt{0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141}
$$

- $h$ is the cofactor.

$$
h = 1
$$

### Key Generation

#### Private Key

A private key is a randomly selected scalar from the range $[1, n-1]$, where $n$ is the order of the elliptic curve group. The private key is used to generate the public key.

The space of possible private keys is vast due to the high order of the elliptic curve, making it computationally infeasible to guess or brute force a private key.

#### Public Key

A public key is a point on the elliptic curve that is generated by multiplying the base point $G$ by the private key.

$$
\text{Public Key} = \text{Private Key} â‹… G
$$


### The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a cryptographic algorithm used to generate digital signatures, which ensure the authenticity and integrity of data. Here's an outline of how ECDSA operates.

In the steps below, $H(m)$ refers to the hash of a message $m$ that is to be signed, and the opration $H(m)$ is assumed to be a cryptographic hash function.

#### Signature Generation

To sign a message $m$ using the $\text{Private Key}$:

1. Choose a random scalar $\lambda$ from the range $[1, n-1]$
2. Compute the point $P$ on the elliptic curve:
$$
R = \lambda G
$$
3. With $R=(x_r,y_r)$, check that $r = x_r \mod n \neq 0$, if so, go back to step 1.

4. Compute the signature $s$, if $s = 0$, go back to step 1:
$$
s = \lambda^{-1}(H(m) + r \cdot \text{Private Key}) \mod n
$$
5. The signature is the pair $(r, s)$.

#### Signature Verification

To verify a signature $(r, s)$ of a message $m$ using the $\text{Public Key}$:

1. Compute the modular inverse of $s$:
$$
w = s^{-1} \mod n
$$
2. Compute $u_1$:
$$
u_1 = w \cdot H(m) \mod n
$$
3. Compute $u_2$:
$$
u_2 = w \cdot r \mod n
$$
4. Compute the verification point $V$:
$$
V = u_1 \cdot G + u_2 \cdot \text{Public Key}
$$
5. With $V=(x_v,y_v)$, if $r = x_v \mod n$  (i.e. $V=R$) the signature is valid, meaning that the message $m$ was signed by the owner of the $\text{Private Key}$


> The modular inverse of $s$ is the number $w$ such that $s \cdot w \equiv 1 \mod n$. \
It is usually computed using the [extended Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm).

Proof of the verification:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V &= u_1 \cdot G + u_2 \cdot \text{Public Key} \\
&= w \cdot H(m) \cdot G + w \cdot r \cdot \text{Public Key} \\
&= w \cdot (H(m) \cdot G + r \cdot \text{Public Key}) \\
&= w \cdot (H(m) \cdot G + r \cdot \text{Private Key} \cdot G) \\
&= w \cdot (H(m) + r \cdot \text{Private Key}) \cdot G \\
&= s^{-1} \cdot (H(m) + r \cdot \text{Private Key}) \cdot G \\
&= s^{-1} \cdot s \cdot \lambda \cdot G \\
&= \lambda \cdot G \\
&= R
\end{aligned}
$$
